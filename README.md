This is a portfolio project I made for learning purpose: a search engine made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

For taking a demo on how this search engine works, consider searching for keywords like 'dog', 'BBC', 'IIT Kanpur', 'Aviral Verma', etc.

 The search engine can be accessed at the link: https://bonzersearch.000webhostapp.com/
